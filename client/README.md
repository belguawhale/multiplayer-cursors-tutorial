# Multiplayer Cursors Tutorial

Followed this tutorial for websockets in React: https://ably.com/blog/websockets-react-tutorial

I removed `perfect-cursors` and just used a 0.1s css transition since it was too slow for my liking. I also made the current user's cursor track exactly and converted much of the code to typescript.
